This program is a simple tool that hides a message by scrambling the letters into a new order. It works by arranging the letters of the message in a zig-zag pattern across several rows, kind of like writing diagonally down and then back up again. After the message is placed into this zig-zag shape, the program reads the letters row by row to create the encrypted version of the message. The number of rows you choose changes the pattern, and you can also decide which row to start from, which makes the result look different each time.
